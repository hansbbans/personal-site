When retrieving my items, their truck ran out of space so I was forced to schedule another session, losing time and money.\n2. I retreived items 3 times.  Each time, an item was lost and not included in the original delivery.  One of the items still has not been found.\n3. There was no followup on their side about the lost item even though that's what the original email from them states..  It's only when I asked that they admitted there's a way to file claims.\n4. They provide estimates for delivery.  Each estimate was low and ended up costing several hundreds dollars more.  When I asked why the estimates were inaccurate, they said something about changing industry costs. Sure, but what does that have to do with giving an accurate estimate.\n5. Items that were delivered were damaged.\n\nEven if this service seems cheaper, it's not worth it.  Stay away."

Each sales meeting had periods of time where I was kept sitting around waiting despite the fact that I had made appointments beforehand.  Eventually, I agreed to a 3,999 down $299 a month lease.  I was very explicit that I did not want my monthly payments to exceed $400 in total.    After I signed the initial papers on Jan 24th, I was told the car would be ready by end of month.   At end of month, I called asking if the car was ready, and was repeatedly told it would be here in \"1-2 days\" according to their computer.  Note, that the dealer did not do outreach one time.  I had to call each time every two days to try to get updates on the car.\n\nAfter finally telling my salesperson I would probably need to start shopping again due to delays, the car was magically ready the next day.  When I went to go pick up the car, I was told I owed 9,400 down.  An incredible $5,000 in taxes and fees that had not once been discussed was now added on to the final price.  When I explained that I did not want to go over my $400 monthly budget, multiple sales manager tried to roll taxes and fees into the monthly payment.  This did nothing to reduce the overall price - it was just a sleight of hand to try to shift money around.  I even confronted each manager about this and they reassurred me I was getting \"a better price\" even though anyone who understands basic arithmetic knows that's not the case.\n\nStay away from this dealer and save yourself the time and frustration."

### What This Means

2. **Opportunity** — 149 highly-rated spots you're missing (25 x 6 - 1)
3. **Validation** — Ariete being on both lists confirms you can pick winners

### Recommendations

**High Priority Adds** (Infatuation favorites, easy to get to):
- **NYC:** Thai Diner, Via Carota
- **LA:** Anajak Thai (weeks-long waitlist, plan ahead)
- **SF:** San Ho Won (Korean BBQ — better than your current KBBQ picks?)
- **London:** Bibi (Indian in Mayfair), St. John (nose-to-tail classic)
- **Paris:** Septime (impossible to book but worth trying), L'Ami Jean

**Medium Priority:**
- **LA:** Holbox (mariscos in Mercado La Paloma)
- **SF:** Noodle In A Haystack (impossible reservations, 10 seats)
- **Miami:** Tâm Tâm (Vietnamese), Boia De (Italian)
